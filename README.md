# Multi-Threaded Web Server (Java)

This repository contains a Java-based multi-threaded web server project.

## Directory Structure

- `.gitignore`  
  Standard gitignore file specifying files and directories to be ignored by Git.

- `.idea/`  
  Project configuration files for JetBrains IDEs (such as IntelliJ IDEA).

- `pom.xml`  
  Maven Project Object Model file, containing project dependencies and build configuration.

- `src/`  
  Source code directory.
  
  - `main/`  
    Main source set for the Java application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Maven (for dependency management and building the project)

### Building the Project

To build the project, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
mvn clean install
```

This will compile the source code and package the application.

### Running the Server

Instructions for running the web server will depend on the main class and configuration found within `src/main`. After building, you can typically run the server using:

```sh
java -jar target/<your-jar-file>.jar
```

Replace `<your-jar-file>.jar` with the actual jar file name generated in the `target` directory after building.

## Project Structure

- The main source code for the server is located in `src/main`.
- Project dependencies and build steps are managed via `pom.xml`.
- IDE-specific settings are stored in the `.idea` directory.
